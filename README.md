# User and Contacts Management API  

This is a **Node.js** and **MongoDB**-based RESTful API designed to manage users and their associated contacts. The API includes secure authentication and authorization mechanisms using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). A **React-based UI** is currently under development to complement the API for a seamless user experience.  

## Features

  - Secure user login with token generation.  
  - Authorization to ensure only authenticated users can access or modify their contacts.  

- **Scalable and Modular Design**  
  - Built with **Express.js** for an organized and extendable structure.  
  - Optimized API endpoints for performance and scalability.  

- **Database Integration**  
  - Powered by **MongoDB**, offering flexible and efficient data storage.  

- **Security**  
  - Password hashing with **Bcrypt** for secure user authentication.  
  - Middleware for token validation and request authorization.
